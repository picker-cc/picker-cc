# Anu

> Anu means [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) ‚öõÔ∏è

## Why anu?

- Yes, there's UnoCSS, TailwindCSS, etc but they don't provide ready to use components
- DX Focused. You will enjoy writing code üíØ
- [Configure UI](/guide/base-components/typography.html#config-array) using array instead of writing component's markup again to override
- It is for lazy people by lazy person
- I co-authored premium templates like [Vuexy](https://themeforest.net/item/vuexy-vuejs-html-laravel-admin-dashboard-template/23328599), [Materio](https://themeselection.com/item/materio-vuetify-vuejs-admin-template), etc so you can expect neat & lovable UI from anu.
- Thanks to UnoCSS, VueUse, etc You can build your desired UI  & functionalities in no time using battle tested features.
- Customization is a piece of cake with anu. It is as simple as overriding an object ü§Ø

## Motivation

I work at [ThemeSelection](https://themeselection.com) and for couple of times I had to build small Vue projects that required UI flexibility. I couldn't use Bootstrap because customization is not straight forward compared to frameworks like UnoCSS, WindiCSS & TailwindCSS.

Then there's a guy named [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu) who is great inspiration to me. He built great tools for vue ecosystem and I was using them in my every vue projects. Now the problem was repating the configuration & components in every project and there wasn't any component lib based on frameworks like UnoCSS to provide components for building UI quickly and provide enough flexibility.

Hence, I created this UI lib which provides ready to use beautiful components with utilities to build UI quickly.

### Why not TailwindCSS

You probably didn't read the UnoCSS [README](https://github.com/unocss/unocss#readme).

### Why dependencies

Anu is based on [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss), [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) & [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/). Anu have this dependencies because there's a saying "_Don't reinvent the wheel_".
